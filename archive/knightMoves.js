Sure, I can give you an overview of how to implement the knight's travails problem in an 8x8 field using code.

The knight's travails problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that involves finding the shortest path between two points on a chessboard that are reachable by a knight's move. The problem can be solved using a graph search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores all possible moves from the starting point until the destination is reached.

Here are the general steps you can follow to implement the knight's travails problem in an 8x8 field:

Define a function to represent the chessboard as a graph, with each square on the board as a node and each valid knight's move as an edge. You can represent each node as a tuple of integers (x, y), where x and y are the row and column numbers, respectively.

Define a BFS function to search for the shortest path between the starting and destination nodes. The BFS function should take the starting and destination nodes as input, and return the shortest path as a list of nodes.

To represent the knight's moves, define a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of two steps in each direction (up, down, left, right), followed by one step in the perpendicular direction. For example, the list can be defined as [(1,2), (2,1), (-1,2), (-2,1), (1,-2), (2,-1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1)].

For each node on the board, generate a list of valid moves that can be made by a knight from that node. To do this, iterate through the list of knight move combinations and check if the resulting node is within the bounds of the board (i.e., x and y are between 0 and 7). If the resulting node is valid, add it to the list of valid moves for that node.

Call the BFS function with the starting and destination nodes, and use the valid moves generated in step 4 to explore the graph. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node, and return the shortest path when the destination node is found.

Here is some sample code to illustrate these steps:

/*
function knightMoves(start, end):
    if start or end is invalid:
        return "Invalid input"
    
    create an 8x8 matrix to represent the chess board
    set all elements in the matrix to 0
    
    define the possible moves for the knight
    moves = [[-2, -1], [-2, 1], [-1, -2], [-1, 2], [1, -2], [1, 2], [2, -1], [2, 1]]
    
    define a queue to store the squares to visit
    enqueue the starting square with an empty path
    
    while the queue is not empty:
        dequeue the square at the front of the queue
        get its coordinates and path
        
        if the square is the end square:
            add the end square to the path and return the path
        
        visit all the neighboring squares:
            for each move in moves:
                calculate the new coordinates of the neighboring square
                if the new square is valid and has not been visited:
                    mark the new square as visited in the matrix
                    enqueue the new square with the updated path
    
    return "No path found"
